Welcome to upload-py's documentation!
=====================================

This is a simple CGI script written in Python 2.6 that is used to connect to a SQLite3 database, and upload a PDF and JPG cover for a book the user specifies to the filesystem. It is used in conjunction with a HTML form, using POST to send information to the script to perform the upload and insert into the database.
